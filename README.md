# Agents External Stubs

[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/hmrc/releases/agents-external-stubs/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/hmrc/releases/agents-external-stubs/_latestVersion)

Agents External Stubs is the primary stub you need to run and test Agent Services locally and in other stubbed environments. 
It replaces gg-stubs and agents-stubs together with auth, company-auth-frontend, enrolment-store-proxy, tax-enrolments, users-groups-search, citizen-details, DES and datastream. 

You will have to run [UI stubs](https://github.com/hmrc/agents-external-stubs-frontend) as well in order to be able to sign-in seamlessly into your application.

Support channel: `#event-agents-external-stubs`

This service SHOULD NOT be run on PRODUCTION environment.

## Principles

- dynamic (data can be changed, no initial data included)
- persistent (data are persisted until modified or removed)
- programmable (data can be created and retrieved entirely through the custom API)
- smart (only minimal input needed, sensibly auto-generates missing values)
- complete (feels and behaves like real API would)
- multi-tenant (test data are sandboxed into planets, multiple data planets can co-exist)
- self-contained (does not need any other services to run)
- easy-to-use (through ergonomic API and complementary UI frontend)

## Features

- user and enrolment model
- ETMP/DES records model
- auth and other services drop-in replacement
- generic proxy with pre-defined responses (special cases)
- agent-access-control support
- external auth and api-platform-test-user link

## Data Model
Every stubbed user and other data types live in some test sandbox (planet). 
You have to declare existing or a new planet whenever you sign-in. 
Each authenticated session have planetId information. 
Stubbed and custom UIs will consider only users and data assigned to the current planet.

User authentication expires after 15 minutes and so does the bearer token.

## How requests are handled?

We handle local requests gracefully and do not require existing applications to reconfigure, i.e. we provide necessary TCP proxies:

- listening on 8500 for auth requests
- listening on 9978 for user-details requests
- listening on 9337 for citizen-details requests
- listening on 9984 for users-groups-search requests
- listening on 7775 for enrolment-store-proxy requests
- listening on 9111 for ni-exemption-registration requests
- listening on 9904 for des requests
- listening on 8100 for datastream events
- listening on 9974 for sso requests
- listening on 8898 for file-upload requests

You can switch this behaviour off by setting `features.proxies` config property to `false`.

## How to configure generic proxy and stub pre-defined responses

This service can handle arbitrary requests and proxy them to the target service if possible or return pre-defined response. 
Target service name is determined based on the URL path prefix and its location looked up in the configuration:

- protocol: `microservice.services.{service-name}.protocol`
- host: `microservice.services.{service-name}.host`
- port: `microservice.services.{service-name}.port`

Any stubbed or proxied APIs request can return pre-defined response defined using [Special Cases](#custom_api_special_case).

## Testing performance with stubs

To achieve high volume throughput and low latency required for performance testing you may consider deploy only *single* stubs instance and switch on few optimisations options:
* `features.authCache` - to aggressively cache all auth authorisations in memory,
* `features.preloadRecordsForDefaultUserIds` - to preload record template caches with entities generated for the default user ids pool, this will work well with `userIdFromPool` query parameter attached to the sign-in and create user requests,
* `features.clearOldMongoDbDocumentsDaily` - to clear stubs database daily at 12:30 AM UTC.
